# Stratgg
<p>
Here at Stratgg, we want to create a competitive scene for teens (under 18) to get recognized for their abilities in video games. 
We will provide opportunities for teens to get recruited to professional esports or college teams. 
Stratgg will maintain personal relationships with colleges and coaches nationwide, allowing our members to receive university scholarships. 

Youth teams will compete against other youth teams online and in LAN events (in-person). Stratgg is committed to developing kids as a person first, then a player. 
Players will have their own profile on our website showcasing their bio, stats, and highlights, competing for the top ranks. Think of Stratgg as the AAU of video games.

## Goals

1. Create an online competitive league where gamers under 18 can join or create their own teams to compete in a variety of esports titles. Our aim is to provide them with opportunities to be recruited for college esports programs or professional teams.

2. Establish ourselves as the leading platform for colleges and professional esports teams to discover and recruit talented players. We strive to be the go-to source for recruitment in popular esports titles.

3. Enable kids to participate in multiple esports titles of their choice, fostering their passion for gaming and allowing them to explore various competitive opportunities, rather than restricting them to a single game.
